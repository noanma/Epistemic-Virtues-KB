# How to Facilitate Feedback That Cultivates Intellectual Humility

## Problem

Workshop participants give superficial, overly-nice feedback ("I loved it!") or harsh, dismissive criticism that shuts down learning. Neither approach helps creators grow, and both can damage the trust needed for intellectual risk-taking.

## When to use this guide

- Running creative workshops where participants critique each other's work
- Facilitating peer review sessions
- Creating feedback protocols for collaborative projects
- Noticing feedback has become either too gentle or too harsh

## Prerequisites

- Understanding of intellectual humility (owning limitations, being open to being wrong)
- Basic workshop facilitation experience
- Established group agreements or norms

## Solution

1. Set the Frame.
Before any feedback session, explain:
    
    "Good feedback requires intellectual humility from everyone, both the person sharing and those responding. If you're sharing, intellectual humility means acknowledging your work isn't perfect and being genuinely open to seeing its limitations. If you're giving feedback, it means recognizing you might be wrong, that your perspective is just one of many, and that you don't have all the answers."

Why this matters: 
Explicitly naming the virtue being practiced helps participants recognize it as a skill they're developing, not just a workshop rule.

2. Introduce the "I Notice / I Wonder" Framework.
Teach participants to structure feedback as:

- "I notice..." (objective observations)
- "I wonder..." (curious questions, not disguised criticism)

    Examples:

    - Good:
    "I notice the character doesn't speak until page 3. I wonder what would change if they spoke earlier?"
    "I notice lots of warm colors in the piece. I wonder how it would feel with a cool color palette?"
    - Avoid:
    "You should make the character talk sooner" (prescriptive, not humble)
    "The colors are wrong" (judgmental, not curious)

Why this framework works:

- "I notice" forces observation over interpretation
- "I wonder" frames responses as questions, not answers
- Both require the feedback-giver to acknowledge they might be wrong

3. Practice "Steel-manning".
Before offering criticism, participants must:

- Identify what's working in the piece
- Articulate the creator's likely intention
- Describe the strongest version of what the creator is attempting

    Example:
    "It seems like you're trying to create a sense of unease through the sparse dialogue. The strongest version of this would be if the silence itself became a character. What I'm noticing is..."

Why this matters:
Steel-manning requires intellectual humility because you must seriously engage with perspectives or approaches different from what you would choose.

4. Implement "Feedback Sandwich" with Humility Markers.
Structure: Strength → Question → Strength
But add humility markers:

- "This might just be my taste, but..."
- "I could be wrong about this..."
- "Other people might see this differently..."
- "I'm genuinely curious whether..."

    Example:
    "The imagery in the opening is really strong—I can see this world clearly. I'm genuinely curious whether the pacing in the middle section achieves what you want, because I found myself wanting to slow down and spend more time there. But that might just be my reading style. The ending really landed for me."

5. Create "Clarifying Question" Time.
Before any evaluative feedback, require a round of only clarifying questions:
- "What were you trying to achieve with...?"
- "Can you say more about your intention for...?"
- "What were you experimenting with in...?"

Why this matters:
Asking genuine questions (rather than rhetorical ones that mask criticism) is an act of intellectual humility—acknowledging you don't fully understand the creator's intentions.

## Variations

**For written work**:
Have participants write feedback using the frameworks above, which allows for more thoughtful, less reactive responses.

**For visual art**:
Use "What I see / What I think it might mean / What I'm curious about" structure.

**For performance**:
Record performances so feedback can reference specific moments, making observations more concrete and less personal.

## Common Pitfalls

**Problem**: Participants use "I wonder" as veiled criticism
*Solution*: "I wonder why you made such a terrible choice" isn't genuine wondering. Model the difference between genuine curiosity and rhetorical questions. Stop and reframe when you notice it.

**Problem**: Too much focus on intellectual humility makes feedback toothless
*Solution*: Intellectual humility doesn't mean avoiding hard truths. Model: "I might be wrong, but I think this section isn't working yet, and here's specifically why..."

**Problem**: Creators become defensive despite the framework
*Solution*: Add a "silent receiving" norm where the creator only listens and takes notes during feedback, speaking only to ask clarifying questions. Response comes later or not at all.
