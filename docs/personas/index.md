# Who is the Knowledge Base for?

## Overview

This knowledge base serves anyone interested in cultivating epistemic virtues—the intellectual character traits that help us think well, inquire effectively, and pursue truth responsibly. While the content is broadly applicable, we've designed it with specific audiences in mind.

## Primary Audiences

We've developed detailed personas representing our core user groups. These personas help us create relevant, practical content that addresses real needs and challenges.

### Educators in Formal Settings

#### **High School Teacher - Formal K-12 education**

She teaches 10th grade English and wants to help her students think critically about the texts they read and the arguments they encounter. She's looking for practical strategies she can integrate into her existing curriculum without requiring specialized training in philosophy or epistemology.

**Needs:**

- Classroom-ready strategies that don't require major curriculum overhaul
- Ways to address student overconfidence and closed-mindedness
- Methods for modeling intellectual virtues authentically
- Approaches that work within time and assessment constraints

#### **University Professor - Higher education**

He teaches undergraduate philosophy and is deeply committed to intellectual character development, but struggles to balance content coverage with the time needed to cultivate thinking dispositions. He wants to make epistemic virtue development explicit in his courses while maintaining academic rigor.

**Needs:**

- Sophisticated understanding of epistemic virtue theory
- Assignment designs that assess epistemic growth
- Discussion facilitation techniques for diverse perspectives
- Ways to address academic dishonesty as an epistemic vice issue

### Educators Outside Formal Settings

#### **Community Organizer - Adult community education**

She facilitates adult learning programs and community dialogues on civic issues. She sees how epistemic vices—confirmation bias, intellectual arrogance, and incuriosity—undermine productive community discourse. She wants frameworks for helping adults develop better thinking habits.

**Needs:**

- Non-academic language and frameworks
- Strategies for working with adults who may be defensive
- Ways to navigate politically charged contexts
- Techniques for one-time workshops vs. ongoing programs

#### **Youth Program Director - Informal youth education**

He runs after-school and summer programs for middle school students. He wants to help young people develop intellectual curiosity, open-mindedness, and critical thinking, but works outside traditional classroom structures and assessment systems.

**Needs:**

- Approaches suited to informal learning environments
- Activities that feel engaging rather than "educational"
- Ways to measure growth without grades or tests
- Strategies for working with diverse skill levels simultaneously

### Parents and Caregivers

#### **Parent - Parenting and family life**

She is a parent of two children (ages 8 and 13) who wants to raise intellectually curious, humble, and thoughtful kids. She's concerned about the overconfident claims she sees on social media and wants to help her children develop good thinking habits, but doesn't have a teaching background.

**Needs:**

- Everyday parenting strategies, not formal lessons
- Ways to model virtues in family life
- Age-appropriate approaches for different developmental stages
- Guidance on responding to children's questions and claims
- Balance between encouraging confidence and teaching humility

#### **Homeschooling Parent - Homeschool education**

He homeschools his three children and has the flexibility to integrate epistemic virtue development throughout their learning. He wants structured guidance on how to make intellectual character development a central part of their education.

**Needs:**

- Curriculum integration strategies across subjects
- Assessment approaches for epistemic growth
- Resources for teaching children to self-monitor their thinking
- Ways to avoid the echo chamber effect of single-teacher education

## Secondary Audiences

While not our primary focus, these groups may also find value in this knowledge base:

### Self-Directed Learners

Individuals interested in developing their own epistemic virtues, whether for professional development, personal growth, or intellectual enrichment.

**What you'll find useful:**

- [Tutorial: Self-Assessment and Goal Setting](../tutorials/self-assessment-tutorial.md)
- Explanations of individual virtues and how they develop
- Reflective exercises and metacognitive strategies

### Educational Leaders and Administrators

School principals, program directors, and curriculum developers who want to make epistemic virtue development a systemic priority rather than leaving it to individual teachers.

**What you'll find useful:**

- Understanding of why epistemic virtues matter institutionally
- Frameworks for school-wide implementation
- Assessment and evaluation considerations

### Educational Researchers

Scholars studying intellectual character development, virtue epistemology in practice, or educational philosophy.

**What you'll find useful:**

- Theoretical foundations drawn from Baehr, Proust, Lipman, and others
- Connections between theory and practice
- References for deeper study

## How to Use the Personas

Each persona page includes:

- **Background and context:** Who they are and what they're trying to accomplish
- **Goals and motivations:** What they hope to achieve
- **Challenges and pain points:** What obstacles they face
- **How this knowledge base helps:** Specific content tailored to their needs
- **Recommended starting points:** Where to begin based on their role

You don't need to fit perfectly into one persona to benefit from this knowledge base. Most real users will see themselves in multiple personas or find that their needs evolve over time. The personas are guides, not gates.

## What This Means for Content Design

Understanding our audiences shapes how we create content:

- **Multiple entry points:** Theory-heavy explanations for those who want depth, practical how-to guides for those who need immediate strategies
- **Varied examples:** Classroom scenarios, family situations, community contexts, and self-directed learning applications
- **Jargon-conscious:** We define technical terms and provide plain language alternatives
- **Context-aware:** We acknowledge different constraints (time, resources, institutional support, student age/readiness)
- **Non-prescriptive:** We offer frameworks and principles rather than rigid scripts, recognizing that you know your context best

## If You Don't See Yourself Here

These personas represent common user types, but they're not exhaustive. If you're:

- A tutor or mentor working one-on-one
- A librarian or information literacy educator
- A workplace trainer or corporate educator
- A religious educator or youth minister
- A writing center consultant or academic coach
- Anyone else interested in epistemic virtues

...you'll likely still find applicable content. Focus on the **how-to guides** and **tutorials** for practical strategies, and the **explanations** for conceptual understanding. The reference documentation provides definitions and frameworks you can adapt to your context.

## We Want to Hear From You

These personas are based on research and our understanding of who needs this work, but real users always surprise us. If you're using this knowledge base and don't see your needs reflected, or if you have suggestions for how it could better serve your context, please let me know.
