# Facilitating Your First Socratic Seminar

## Overview

This tutorial guides you through planning and facilitating your first Socratic seminar. It is a structured discussion format that practices multiple intellectual virtues simultaneously. By the end, you'll have led a meaningful dialogue where students think together, challenge ideas respectfully, and experience the value of collaborative inquiry.

**Target Audience:** This tutorial is primarily designed for:
- 

**What you'll learn:**
- How to prepare for a Socratic seminar
- Step-by-step facilitation from opening to closing
- How to recognize and support intellectual virtues during discussion
- Ways to handle common challenges

**Time required:** 
- 2-3 hours preparation
- 45-60 minutes for the seminar itself
- 15 minutes debrief

**Prerequisites:**
- Students have some familiarity with at least 2-3 intellectual virtues (see [Building a Classroom Culture of Curiosity](link))
- A text, question, or problem suitable for discussion (guidance provided below)
- Willingness to let students drive the conversation (this is hard!)

**Important:** Your first Socratic seminar will feel messy. That's normal and actually desirable. The goal is meaningful struggle with ideas, not polished performance.

## What Is a Socratic Seminar?

A Socratic seminar is a collaborative, intellectual dialogue where students:
- Explore a complex question or text together
- Build on each other's thinking
- Challenge ideas (not people) respectfully
- Think out loud and change their minds
- Take responsibility for the quality of the discussion

**What it is NOT:**
- A debate (no winners/losers)
- A teacher-led Q&A (you facilitate, don't dominate)
- A chance to show who's smartest (it's collaborative, not competitive)
- A free-for-all (there's structure and purpose)

As Baehr notes, "in many situations, virtuous thinking is a precondition for morally responsible behavior" (p. 24). Socratic seminars practice the virtuous thinking needed for genuine dialogue.

**Key virtues practiced:**
- **Intellectual humility** (acknowledging uncertainty, being open to being wrong)
- **Open-mindedness** (seriously considering others' perspectives)
- **Intellectual courage** (speaking up, questioning assumptions)
- **Attentiveness** (listening carefully to others)
- **Curiosity** (asking genuine questions)
- **Intellectual autonomy** (forming your own judgments)

## Two Weeks Before: Selecting Your Text or Question

### Task: Choose something worth thinking about together

**Good texts for a first seminar:**
- A short story with moral complexity (Shirley Jackson's "The Lottery," Ursula K. Le Guin's "The Ones Who Walk Away from Omelas")
- A thought-provoking article on a relevant issue
- A primary source document (historical speech, founding document excerpt)
- A philosophical thought experiment (trolley problem variations)
- A poem with multiple interpretations
- A scientific concept with ethical implications
- A mathematical paradox or puzzle

**Or formulate a central question:**
- "What do we owe to people we've never met?"
- "Is it ever right to break a rule?"
- "What makes something art?"
- "Can you ever really know another person?"

**Criteria for good seminar material:**
- No single "right answer"
- Multiple valid interpretations possible
- Connects to students' lives or genuine questions
- Rich enough to sustain 45+ minutes of conversation
- Accessible but not simplistic

**What to avoid for your first seminar:**
- Highly controversial current events (emotions may overwhelm thinking)
- Material requiring extensive background knowledge
- Texts so complex students can't engage
- Topics where you have a strong agenda about the "right" answer

**Why this matters:**  
The quality of the discussion depends heavily on the quality of the material. Choose something you're genuinely curious about, not something you want to "teach" them.

## One Week Before: Preparing Students

### Day 1: Introduce the Format

**Task:** Explain what a Socratic seminar is and why it matters.

**How:**
1. Say something like:
   
   "Next week, we're going to try something called a Socratic seminar. It's named after Socrates, an ancient Greek philosopher who believed the best way to understand something was through dialogue—asking questions and thinking together.
   
   In a Socratic seminar, YOU will lead the discussion. My job is just to help keep it going. Your job is to think together about a question that doesn't have easy answers.
   
   This will probably feel different from regular class discussions. There's no 'right answer' I'm looking for. I'm genuinely curious what you'll discover together."

2. Explain the basic structure:
   - We'll sit in a circle (or outer/inner circle for larger classes)
   - I'll pose an opening question
   - You'll discuss while I mostly listen
   - The goal is to think together, not win an argument

3. Ask: "What feels exciting about this? What feels scary?"

**Why this matters:**  
Students need to understand this isn't a regular class discussion. Setting expectations reduces anxiety and helps them understand their role.

**What success looks like:**  
Students express both interest and nervousness. They understand this will require them to think and speak, not just listen.

---

### Day 2-3: Introduce Discussion Norms

**Task:** Co-create norms for respectful, productive dialogue.

**How:**
1. Ask: "What makes a discussion feel safe and productive? What makes it feel uncomfortable or pointless?"

2. Collect student ideas and add essential ones they miss:
   - Listen to understand, not just to respond
   - Refer to the text/question, not just opinions
   - Challenge ideas, not people
   - Make space for others to speak
   - It's okay to change your mind
   - It's okay to say "I'm not sure" or "I need to think about that"
   - Build on what others say ("Building on what Alex said...")
   - Ask genuine questions

3. Frame these as practicing intellectual virtues:
   - Listening to understand = **attentiveness** and **open-mindedness**
   - Challenging ideas respectfully = **intellectual courage** and **humility**
   - Saying "I'm not sure" = **intellectual humility**
   - Building on others = **curiosity** and **thoroughness**

4. Post the norms visibly

**Why this matters:**  
As Baehr notes, "The practice of intellectual rigor in the classroom requires an ethos of trust and acceptance" (p. 169). Co-creating norms builds that ethos.

**What success looks like:**  
Students feel ownership of the norms. They understand these aren't just "rules" but ways of practicing virtues.

---

### Day 4: Teach "Talk Moves"

**Task:** Give students concrete language for participating well.

**How:**
Introduce specific sentence stems:

**For building on ideas:**
- "Building on what [name] said..."
- "That connects to..."
- "That makes me think of..."

**For respectfully disagreeing:**
- "I see it differently because..."
- "I'm wondering if we could also consider..."
- "That's an interesting point, and I'm thinking..."

**For asking for clarity:**
- "Can you say more about that?"
- "What do you mean by...?"
- "Can you point to where you see that in the text?"

**For acknowledging uncertainty:**
- "I'm not sure, but I'm thinking..."
- "I'm still working this out, but..."
- "That's a good question—I don't know"

**For inviting others:**
- "What does everyone else think?"
- "Has anyone else thought about this?"

**Why this matters:**  
Intellectual virtues require skills (Chapter 2). These talk moves are the skills of virtuous dialogue. Providing language lowers barriers to participation.

**What success looks like:**  
Students practice using the stems. They sound a bit stilted at first—that's fine. Fluency comes with practice.

---

### Day 5: Assign the Reading/Preparation

**Task:** Have students engage with the text or question before the seminar.

**How:**
1. Provide the text or question

2. Ask students to prepare by:
   - Reading/reviewing carefully (perhaps multiple times)
   - Noting 2-3 passages or ideas that seem important or puzzling
   - Writing down at least 2 questions the text raises for them
   - Identifying one place where they're uncertain or could see multiple perspectives

3. Optional: Use a thinking routine like "I Notice / I Wonder" or "See-Think-Wonder" (see Chapter 8)

4. Emphasize: "There's no right interpretation I'm looking for. I want to know what YOU think and wonder."

**Why this matters:**  
Preparation supports intellectual autonomy—students form their own thinking before the group discussion. It also ensures everyone has something to contribute.

**What success looks like:**  
Most students come prepared with notes, questions, or marked texts. They've genuinely engaged with the material.

---

## The Day Before: Your Final Preparation

### Task: Prepare yourself as facilitator

**How:**

1. **Prepare 3-5 opening questions** of increasing depth:
   - Level 1 (accessible): "What's your first reaction to this text/question?"
   - Level 2 (analytical): "Where do you see the central tension or conflict?"
   - Level 3 (interpretive): "What do you think the author wants us to understand?"
   - Level 4 (evaluative): "Do you agree with the text's assumptions?"
   - Level 5 (personal/philosophical): "How does this connect to your own experience?"

2. **Identify 2-3 key passages or ideas** you hope students will discuss (but don't force)

3. **Prepare follow-up prompts** in case discussion stalls:
   - "Can someone build on that?"
   - "Does anyone see it differently?"
   - "Where in the text do you see evidence for that?"
   - "What questions does that raise?"

4. **Arrange the room:** Circle or double circle (inner/outer for large classes)

5. **Prepare materials:**
   - Timer (to track time, not to limit speakers)
   - Observation sheet if you're taking notes
   - Copy of the text

6. **Mentally prepare yourself:**
   - Your job is to facilitate, not teach
   - Silence is productive—don't fill it too quickly
   - Let students struggle with ideas
   - Model intellectual humility by being genuinely curious about their thinking

**Why this matters:**  
As Baehr emphasizes, teaching postures matter as much as practices (Chapter 4). Your presence, openness, and humility will set the tone.

**What success looks like:**  
You feel prepared but not rigidly planned. You're genuinely curious what students will say. You're ready to follow their thinking, not your agenda.

---

## Day Of: The Seminar Structure (60 minutes)

### Opening (5 minutes)

**Task:** Set the tone and launch the discussion.

**How:**
1. Welcome students and acknowledge any nervousness (yours and theirs)

2. Briefly review norms

3. Remind them of the goal:
   "We're here to think together. You'll run this discussion. I'm going to mostly listen and occasionally ask a question. There's no hidden 'right answer' I'm waiting for. I'm genuinely curious what we'll discover together."

4. Pose your opening question (start with Level 1 or 2)

5. Give 30-60 seconds of silence for thinking

6. Invite someone to begin (or ask "Who'd like to start?")

**What intellectual virtues look like here:**
- **Your humility**: "I don't have the answer"
- **Your courage**: releasing control
- **Students' courage**: being the first to speak

---

### Main Discussion (40-45 minutes)

**Task:** Facilitate while staying mostly in the background.

**Your role:**
- **Listen actively** (model attentiveness)
- **Track who's speaking** (notice who's dominating, who's silent)
- **Let silence happen** (count to 10 before intervening)
- **Ask clarifying questions** when needed
- **Redirect to the text/question** if discussion goes off track
- **Name intellectual virtues** when you see them

**Key facilitation moves:**

**When discussion is flowing:**
- Do nothing. Just listen and take notes.
- Make eye contact with students who seem ready to speak
- Nod to show you're following

**When you hear intellectual virtues:**
Name them briefly:
- "That's intellectual courage—questioning an assumption"
- "I notice intellectual humility—you're acknowledging uncertainty"
- "That's open-mindedness—seriously considering another view"

**When discussion stalls:**
- Wait 10 seconds in silence (it will feel eternal—wait anyway)
- Then ask: "What are people thinking?" or "Who has a question?"
- Use your prepared follow-up prompts
- Refer to a key passage: "What do we make of this part?"

**When a few students dominate:**
- "Let's hear from people who haven't spoken yet"
- "I'm going to wait for some new voices"
- Make eye contact with quieter students

**When someone says something profound:**
- Don't praise effusively (it makes it about you)
- Instead: "Can someone build on that?" or "What does that make you think?"

**When discussion gets heated:**
- Pause and return to the text: "Where do you see evidence for that?"
- Remind: "We're exploring ideas together, not debating sides"
- Model: "I'm hearing two different interpretations. Can both be true?"

**When you disagree with a student:**
- Resist the urge to correct
- Instead: "Interesting. Does anyone see it differently?"
- Or: "What in the text makes you think that?"
- Remember: your job is to facilitate their thinking, not insert yours

**What intellectual virtues look like here:**
- **Attentiveness**: students listening carefully to each other
- **Intellectual courage**: students challenging ideas, admitting confusion
- **Humility**: students saying "I don't know" or changing their minds
- **Open-mindedness**: students considering views different from their own
- **Curiosity**: students asking genuine questions of each other
- **Thoroughness**: students probing deeper into ideas

**Signs it's going well:**
- Students are talking to each other, not just to you
- They're using each other's names
- They're referring to the text
- There's productive disagreement
- Some silence for thinking
- Ideas are building and evolving

**Signs of struggle (that are actually okay):**
- Some awkward pauses
- A few students dominating at first
- Ideas that go in circles
- Disagreements that feel uncomfortable

**Signs you need to intervene:**
- Personal attacks or disrespect
- Complete derailment from the topic
- One student monopolizing for >3 minutes
- Unsafe silence (>20 seconds with no thinking happening)

---

### Closing (10 minutes)

**Task:** Help students reflect on the discussion and their thinking.

**How:**
1. Signal the closing: "We have about 10 minutes left. Let's start bringing this together."

2. Ask a synthesizing question:
   - "How has your thinking changed?"
   - "What's still unresolved or puzzling?"
   - "What was the most interesting idea that came up?"
   - "Where did we find complexity we didn't expect?"

3. Give students a few minutes to write:
   - "What's one thing you're still thinking about?"
   - "What intellectual virtue did you practice today?"
   - "What was challenging about this discussion?"

4. Invite a few to share their reflections

5. Close with appreciation:
   "Thank you for thinking together. You practiced intellectual courage, humility, open-mindedness, and curiosity today. That takes real work, and you did it."

**What intellectual virtues look like here:**
- **Intellectual humility**: acknowledging what's still uncertain
- **Metacognition**: reflecting on one's own thinking process
- **Intellectual autonomy**: articulating one's own evolving views

**What success looks like:**  
Students can articulate how their thinking changed or deepened. They recognize they practiced virtues. Some express wanting to do this again.

---

## Immediately After: Your Reflection

### Task: Reflect while it's fresh

**How:**
Within an hour of the seminar, write notes:

**About the discussion:**
- What went well?
- What surprised you?
- Where did students really think together?
- Where did it stall or struggle?

**About intellectual virtues:**
- Which virtues did you see students practicing?
- Which students showed unexpected strengths?
- Where did you see growth?

**About your facilitation:**
- When did you intervene too much or too little?
- What postures helped or hindered?
- What would you do differently next time?

**About next steps:**
- What follow-up would be valuable?
- What do students need to practice more?
- When will you do another seminar?

**Why this matters:**  
Reflection supports your own growth as a facilitator. You'll learn as much from the first seminar as your students did.

---

## The Next Day: Student Debrief

### Task: Help students process the experience

**How:**
1. Ask students to reflect (writing or discussion):
   - "What was different about the Socratic seminar compared to regular discussions?"
   - "What intellectual virtues did you practice? Which was hardest?"
   - "What did you learn from hearing others' ideas?"
   - "What would help you participate more fully next time?"

2. Share your observations:
   - Name specific moments when you saw virtues in action
   - Acknowledge challenges: "I noticed it was hard when..."
   - Express genuine curiosity: "I was surprised when you all..."

3. Co-create improvements:
   - "What would make our next seminar even better?"
   - "What do we need to practice?"

4. Commit to doing it again:
   - "This is a practice we'll keep developing"
   - "Each seminar will feel different as we get better at this"

**Why this matters:**  
As Baehr notes, "Reflection and self-awareness" support virtue development (Chapter 6). Debriefing helps students recognize what they practiced and how they can grow.

**What success looks like:**  
Students recognize specific intellectual virtues they practiced. They identify areas for growth. Most express interest in trying again.

---

## What You've Accomplished

You have:
- Planned and facilitated a complex, student-centered discussion
- Created an opportunity for students to practice multiple intellectual virtues simultaneously
- Modeled intellectual humility by stepping back and facilitating rather than directing
- Begun building students' capacity for virtuous dialogue
- Taken a significant risk as an educator (releasing control is hard!)

**This is major growth work**—for you and your students.

---

## Planning Your Next Seminar

**Keep doing:**
- Thorough preparation (text selection, questions, logistics)
- Clear norms and expectations
- Facilitating rather than dominating
- Naming virtues when you see them

**Try differently:**
- Based on your reflection, adjust one aspect of facilitation
- Experiment with inner/outer circle if you haven't
- Try a different type of text or question
- Give students more ownership (they pose questions, they facilitate)

**Build toward:**
- More frequent seminars (monthly → bi-weekly → weekly)
- Student-led facilitation
- More complex texts and questions
- Cross-curricular seminars
- Seminars focused on specific virtues

---

## Common Variations for Different Contexts

### For younger students (elementary):
- Shorter seminars (20-30 minutes)
- Picture books or short fables as texts
- More structured turn-taking at first
- Very concrete norms and talk moves
- More frequent check-ins during discussion

### For larger classes:
- Inner/outer circle structure (half discuss while half observe)
- Switch halfway through
- Observers note examples of intellectual virtues they see
- Smaller group seminars that rotate

### For online/hybrid contexts:
- Use breakout rooms for smaller seminars
- Chat for quieter students to contribute
- Digital collaborative document for note-taking
- Recording for later reflection (with student permission)

### For students new to discussion:
- Start with "mini-seminars" (15-20 minutes)
- Very simple texts or questions
- More scaffolding and structure initially
- Gradually release responsibility

## Troubleshooting

**If students won't talk:**
- Wait longer in silence (truly count to 15)
- Use think-pair-share before whole group
- Start with partner discussions
- Lower stakes: "Turn to someone and share what you're thinking"
- Check: did they actually prepare? Do they understand the text?

**If a few students dominate:**
- Directly invite others: "Let's hear from people who haven't spoken yet"
- Use inner/outer circle structure
- Give everyone a set number of "talking chips"
- Acknowledge dominance kindly: "I can see you have more to say, and I want to make space for others"

**If discussion becomes an argument:**
- Pause: "Let's step back. What are we really asking here?"
- Return to text: "Where do you each see evidence?"
- Reframe: "It sounds like you're exploring two different interpretations. Can both be true?"
- Model: "I notice this is getting heated. How can we explore these ideas with intellectual humility?"

**If you can't stay quiet:**
- Literally sit on your hands
- Count to 10 before speaking
- Give yourself a limit: "I will speak maximum 5 times"
- Have a trusted colleague observe and signal when you're over-talking

**If the discussion goes off-topic:**
- Gently redirect: "That's interesting. How does it connect to our question?"
- Ask: "Are we still exploring the same question, or have we moved to a new one?"
- Return to text: "Let's look back at [passage]. What does this tell us?"

**If students say superficial things:**
- Ask: "Can you say more about that?"
- Probe: "What in the text makes you think that?"
- Invite others: "Can someone build on or complicate that idea?"
- Model thoroughness: "That's a start. What else might we consider?"

**If you feel like it was a disaster:**
- Remember: your first seminar will be messy—that's normal
- Ask: Did students think at all? (If yes, it wasn't a disaster)
- Debrief with students—they may have experienced it differently
- Learn from it and try again—each one gets better

---

## A Final Word

Your first Socratic seminar will not be perfect.

You will talk too much or too little. Students will go off-topic. There will be awkward silences. Someone will say something you disagree with and you'll struggle not to correct them.

**All of this is normal.**

What matters is that you created a space where students had to think—really think—together. Where they practiced intellectual virtues not by hearing about them, but by doing them.

As Baehr reminds us, "Intellectual virtues are formed through repeated practice over time" (Chapter 8). This seminar is one practice session. There will be many more.

Each seminar will be different. Each one will teach you something. Each one will help your students grow as thinkers.

You're not behind. You're not doing it wrong.

You're learning alongside your students, which is exactly what intellectually humble educators do.

And that's the best modeling you can offer.
