# Deficiency / Virtue / Excess

**Understanding Intellectual Virtues Through Balance**

Intellectual virtues exist on a spectrum. This framework, rooted in Aristotelian virtue ethics, helps us understand that virtues represent a balanced middle ground between two extremes: deficiency (too little) and excess (too much).

## LEARNING INITIATORS

### Curiosity

![Curiosity](../images/curiosity_vices.png)

**Apathy (Deficiency)**

- Shows no interest in learning or understanding
- Asks no questions, even when confused
- Treats learning as a chore
- "Whatever, I don't really care"

Example: A student who never wonders about anything beyond what's required for a grade

**Curiosity (Virtue)**

- Asks thoughtful, well-timed questions
- Driven by genuine desire to understand
- Knows when to stop asking questions
- Pursues worthwhile subjects, not trivial matters

Example: A learner who asks "Why does this work this way?" and follows up with deeper questions

**Nosiness (Excess)**

- Asks questions that invade privacy or boundaries
- Pursues trivial or salacious information
- Questions relentlessly without regard for context
- Driven by gossip rather than genuine understanding

Example: Someone who constantly asks "How much did that cost?" or pries into personal matters

### Autonomy

![Autonomy](../images/autonomy_vices.png)                                   

**Conformity/Dependence (Deficiency)**

- Cannot form independent judgments
- Simply mirrors others' beliefs
- Constantly asks "What should I think about this?"
- Lacks confidence in own reasoning

Example: A person who changes their opinion based on whoever spoke last

**Autonomy (Virtue)**

- Forms own judgments and conclusions
- Uses evidence and reasoning independently
- Remains appropriately responsive to expert guidance
- Balances independence with openness to input

Example: A thinker who develops their own perspective but welcomes critique and evidence

**Dogmatism (Excess)**

- Refuses to consider others' input or expertise
- Overly confident in own reasoning
- Believes they can figure everything out alone
- Dismisses legitimate authority or expertise

Example: Someone who rejects expert scientific consensus because "I've done my own research"

### Humility

## LEARNING MAINTAINERS

### Attentiveness

![Attentiveness](../images/attentiveness_vices.png)

**Distraction (Deficiency)**

**Carelessness (Deficiency)**

- Makes avoidable errors through sloppiness

Example: A learner who doesn't just know the formula but understands why it works

**Pedantry (Excess)**

## Using These Scales in Teaching

**For Self-Reflection**

Ask students: "Where do you tend to fall on each scale? Which extremes do you lean toward?"


**For Feedback**

Instead of saying "You need more curiosity," say "I noticed you might be leaning toward intellectual apathy here—what questions might you ask?"

**For Goal-Setting**

"This semester, I'm working on moving from intellectual cowardice toward courage, while making sure I don't become reckless."

**or Normalization**

These scales show that everyone struggles—we all tend toward one extreme or another at different times. The virtue is the ongoing practice of finding balance.
