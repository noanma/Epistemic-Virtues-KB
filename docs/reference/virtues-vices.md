Using These Scales in Teaching
For Self-Reflection
Ask students: "Where do you tend to fall on each scale? Which extremes do you lean toward?"
For Feedback
Instead of saying "You need more curiosity," say "I noticed you might be leaning toward intellectual apathy here—what questions might you ask?"
For Goal-Setting
"This semester, I'm working on moving from intellectual cowardice toward courage, while making sure I don't become reckless."
For Normalization
These scales show that everyone struggles—we all tend toward one extreme or another at different times. The virtue is the ongoing practice of finding balance.
