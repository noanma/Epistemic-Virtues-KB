Key terms in epistemic and intellectual virtue education.

## Attentiveness

The habit of being "personally present" in the learning process, helping individuals avoid distractions and dispersion and focus on what is essential. This virtue involves being mentally engaged, noticing important details, and giving appropriate focus to the task at hand.

## Autonomy

The ability to think and form beliefs for oneself. This virtue involves independent thinking while remaining appropriately responsive to evidence, expert guidance, and reasonable criticism. An intellectually autonomous person doesn't simply accept what others say but thinks critically and forms their own reasoned judgments.

## Carefulness

The willingness to detect and avoid methodological errors and mistakes, resulting in a search for accurate conclusions and results. This virtue involves being thorough in one's thinking, checking work for errors, and striving for accuracy and precision.

## Courage

## Curiosity

The disposition to ask thoughtful and insightful questions, driven by a desire to understand and learn. Curiosity initiates the learning process by motivating inquiry and exploration. An intellectually curious person actively seeks knowledge, asks meaningful questions, and pursues understanding beyond surface-level information.
