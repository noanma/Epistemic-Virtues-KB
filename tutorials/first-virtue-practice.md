# Your First Intellectual Courage Practice

## Overview
This tutorial will help you begin practicing intellectual courage in your creative work by learning to share vulnerable, unfinished work in a supportive environment.

### What you'll learn

How to identify and acknowledge your creative fears
Techniques for sharing work-in-progress
Ways to receive feedback with openness

### Time required

30-45 minutes for initial practice

### Prerequisites

A piece of unfinished creative work (writing, art, design, etc.)
A trusted peer or small group
Basic understanding of intellectual courage (sharing despite fear)

## What to do

1. Identify Your Creative Fears

Take 5 minutes to write down answers to these questions:

What am I most afraid will happen if I share this work?
What specific feedback makes me most anxious?
What's the worst realistic outcome?

Example:
"I'm afraid people will think my poem is too sentimental. I worry they'll say it's clichéd or that I'm not a 'real' poet."
Why this matters:
Naming your fears explicitly reduces their power over you and helps you recognize when fear is driving your decisions rather than judgment about your work's readiness.

2. Choose Your First Share

Select a small, manageable piece of work to share—something that feels scary but not overwhelming.
Good first shares:

A single paragraph or stanza
One sketch or design element
A 2-minute excerpt of a longer piece

Why start small:
Building intellectual courage is like building physical strength—you start with manageable challenges and gradually increase difficulty.

3. Frame Your Share

When presenting your work, explicitly state:

What stage it's in ("This is a rough first draft")
What kind of feedback you need ("I'm wondering if the opening hooks you")
What you're NOT ready to hear feedback on yet ("I know the ending needs work—I'm not ready to discuss that yet")

Example:
"This is a very rough first draft of a short story opening. I'm specifically wondering whether the main character's voice feels authentic. I'm not ready for feedback on plot yet."
Why this matters:
Framing helps you maintain some control while still being vulnerable. It's a scaffold for courage, not a shield against all feedback.

4. Share and Listen

Share your work and then:

Listen without defending or explaining
Take notes on what you hear
Thank people for their feedback
Resist the urge to immediately revise

Why this matters:
Practicing receiving feedback without immediate reaction builds your capacity to separate your self-worth from your work.

5. Reflect on the Experience

Within 24 hours, write responses to:

What was most difficult about sharing?
What surprised you about the feedback?
What did you learn about your fears versus reality?
What would you do differently next time?

### What You've Accomplished
You've taken your first deliberate step in practicing intellectual courage. You've:

Named your creative fears explicitly
Shared vulnerable work despite discomfort
Received feedback without defensive reaction
Reflected on the gap between feared and actual outcomes

## Troubleshooting

If you felt paralyzed and couldn't share:
This is normal. Try writing your piece and your fears, then "sharing" by reading them aloud to yourself first. Build up gradually.
If feedback felt crushing:
Review your notes after 48 hours. Often, emotional distance helps us hear the useful parts. Also consider: did you share with the right people? Trust and safety matter.
