This guide provides strategies for helping students calibrate their confidence appropriately while maintaining their engagement and protecting the classroom's intellectual climate.</p> <p>Prerequisites: Understanding of intellectual humility (see Glossary: Intellectual Humility)</p> <p>Why This Matters Overconfidence is one of the most common epistemic vices, even among experts (Proust, 2013). </p> <p>When left unaddressed, it can:</p> <ul> <li>Prevent students from engaging with counterevidence</li> <li>Shut down genuine inquiry and discussion</li> <li>Model poor epistemic habits for other students</li> <li>Lead to intellectual arrogance and closed-mindedness</li> </ul> <p>However, responding poorly\u2014by embarrassing students or dismissing their contributions\u2014can damage trust and discourage participation. The goal is to help students develop appropriate confidence calibration while keeping them intellectually engaged.</p> <p>Steps</p> <ol> <li>Recognize the Type of Overconfidence Before responding, identify what kind of overconfidence you're seeing. Different types require different approaches. Common types:</li> </ol> <p>Borrowed certainty: \"My dad says...\" or \"I saw online that...\" (accepting others' claims uncritically) Overgeneralization: \"All teenagers...\" or \"Nobody believes...\" (universal claims from limited experience) False precision: \"Exactly 73% of people...\" (specific numbers without source or context) Complexity denial: \"It's simple...\" or \"Obviously...\" (dismissing nuance or difficulty) Unqualified causation: \"X causes Y\" (claiming certainty about causal relationships without evidence)</p> <p>Understanding the type helps you target your response effectively. 2. Respond with Curiosity, Not Correction Frame your initial response as genuine inquiry rather than challenge. This keeps the student engaged rather than defensive. In practice: Instead of: \"That's not actually true.\" Try: \"That's interesting. What makes you confident about that?\" Instead of: \"You can't say that for certain.\" Try: \"Help me understand\u2014what's your evidence for that claim?\" Instead of: \"That's an overgeneralization.\" Try: \"When you say 'everyone,' are there exceptions you can think of?\" What this does: Invites metacognitive reflection without triggering defensiveness 3. Ask for Evidence and Reasoning Guide students to examine the basis for their confidence. Useful questions:</p> <p>\"What would we need to know to be confident about that?\" \"Where does that information come from?\" \"What makes this claim strong? What might make us less certain?\" \"How could we test whether that's true?\" \"What would count as evidence against this?\"</p> <p>Example exchange: Student: \"Social media is destroying people's attention spans.\" Teacher: \"That's a strong claim. What evidence are you drawing on?\" Student: \"Well, everyone I know can't focus anymore.\" Teacher: \"Interesting. So you're reasoning from your own observations. What else would we need to know to be really confident about this? Would we need to know about attention spans before social media? Would we need to rule out other explanations?\" What this does: Makes the student's reasoning visible and reveals gaps without direct criticism 4. Model Appropriate Qualification Show students how to express claims with appropriate confidence levels. In practice:</p> <p>\"So it sounds like you're confident based on your personal experience, but we'd need broader data to know if this applies generally.\" \"That's a reasonable hypothesis based on what we know, but we should hold it tentatively until we have more evidence.\" \"This seems likely given X and Y, but there are complications like Z that make me less certain.\"</p> <p>Language to teach: Instead ofTry\"X is true\"\"The evidence suggests X\" or \"X appears to be the case\"\"Everyone knows\"\"Many people believe\" or \"It's commonly thought\"\"Science proves\"\"Research indicates\" or \"Studies suggest\"\"Obviously\"\"It seems\" or \"One interpretation is\"\"Always/Never\"\"Often/Rarely\" or \"In most cases\" What this does: Provides linguistic tools for expressing uncertainty without losing clarity 5. Introduce Counterevidence Gently When students make claims contradicted by evidence, present alternatives without dismissing their contribution. In practice:</p> <p>\"That's one perspective. I've also seen research that suggests...\" (addition, not replacement) \"Interesting. That contradicts something I read recently. Let me share what I found...\" (curiosity about contradiction) \"How would your view account for cases where...\" (invitation to refine, not abandon)</p> <p>Example: Student: \"Violent video games definitely cause violent behavior.\" Teacher: \"I understand why that seems intuitive\u2014if you practice violence virtually, it should carry over. But the research on this is actually complicated. Studies show violent crime has decreased as gaming increased, and most gamers don't become violent. How might we reconcile your intuition with those findings?\" What this does: Respects the student's reasoning while introducing complexity 6. Distinguish Confidence from Truth Help students see that how confident they feel is separate from how confident they should be. In practice:</p> <p>\"You sound very certain. Let's think about whether the evidence warrants that level of confidence.\" \"Feeling sure about something is different from having good reasons to be sure.\" \"Sometimes the things we're most confident about are the things we've thought about least critically.\"</p> <p>Activity suggestion: Have students rate their confidence in various claims (0-100%), then examine the evidence, then re-rate. Discuss when and why their confidence changed. What this does: Develops metacognitive awareness about confidence calibration 7. Protect the Student's Dignity Never embarrass students for being wrong or overconfident. Frame the issue as a shared learning opportunity. In practice:</p> <p>Respond privately when possible for sensitive corrections Use \"we\" language: \"We often feel certain about things based on limited information\" Redirect to the practice rather than the person: \"That claim needs more support\" rather than \"You're being overconfident\" Appreciate the student's engagement: \"I'm glad you're thinking hard about this. Let's dig deeper into the evidence together.\"</p> <p>What to avoid:</p> <p>Public ridicule or sarcasm Accusatory language: \"You have no evidence for that\" Comparisons: \"Other students know better than to claim that\" Dismissive body language (eye rolls, sighs, turning away)</p> <p>What this does: Maintains trust and willingness to take intellectual risks 8. Reinforce Good Calibration When You See It Notice and affirm when students express appropriate uncertainty. In practice:</p> <p>\"I appreciate how you qualified that claim. That's intellectually honest.\" \"Notice how you said 'it seems like' rather than 'it definitely is'\u2014that's good thinking.\" \"That's a tentative conclusion based on limited evidence, and you're right to hold it lightly.\"</p> <p>What this does: Makes intellectual humility visible and valued Handling Specific Situations When a Student Cites Unreliable Sources Confidently Situation: \"I read on Reddit that...\" Response approach:</p> <p>Appreciate the effort to find information Introduce source evaluation: \"That's interesting. Reddit can be a place to encounter ideas, but how would we evaluate whether this particular claim is reliable?\" Model evaluation: \"What would make us more or less confident in this source? Who wrote it? What's their expertise? Is there corroboration elsewhere?\"</p> <p>When Overconfidence Becomes a Pattern Situation: A student repeatedly makes sweeping, unqualified claims. Response approach:</p> <p>Address the pattern privately: \"I've noticed you often express strong certainty. Can we talk about how you're approaching these questions?\" Explore the underlying cause: Is it a habit? A defensive posture? Lack of awareness? Set a personal goal: \"Let's work on qualifying one claim per class this week.\" Follow up with positive reinforcement when you see progress</p> <p>When the Overconfident Claim Dominates Discussion Situation: One student's certainty shuts down inquiry from others. Response approach:</p> <p>Broaden the discussion: \"That's one strong perspective. Let's hear other views before we settle on this.\" Invite complication: \"What are some reasons someone might disagree with this?\" Model multiple perspectives: \"Some people are confident about this, but others are uncertain because...\"</p> <p>When You're Not Sure Whether the Student Is Overconfident Situation: The student might actually have good reasons for their confidence. Response approach:</p> <p>Ask rather than assume: \"You seem very certain. What's making you confident?\" Listen genuinely to their reasoning If their reasoning is sound: \"That makes sense. Given X and Y, that level of confidence seems warranted.\" If not: Proceed with steps above</p> <p>Common Pitfalls Crushing Confidence Entirely Problem: Being so rigorous about qualification that students become paralyzed and won't make any claims. Solution: Emphasize that some confidence is warranted and necessary. The goal is appropriate calibration, not universal doubt. Inconsistency Problem: Challenging some students' overconfidence but not others, or being harsh sometimes and lenient other times. Solution: Develop consistent heuristics for when and how to respond. Apply them fairly across students and contexts. Making It About Being Smart Problem: Framing overconfidence as a sign of stupidity or intellectual inferiority. Solution: Emphasize that overconfidence is a natural human tendency, even among experts. Frame calibration as a skill everyone is developing. Privileging Excessive Uncertainty Problem: Giving the impression that the most qualified, hedged claim is always the best. Solution: Model appropriate confidence when warranted. Show that intellectual humility includes recognizing when you do have good reasons to be confident. Using This as a Control Tactic Problem: Challenging students' confidence as a way to assert authority or win arguments. Solution: Only intervene when genuine epistemic growth is at stake, not to demonstrate your superior knowledge. Reflection Questions After responding to overconfident claims, consider:</p> <p>Did I respond to the claim or to the person? Did I maintain the student's dignity and engagement? Did I help the student understand the basis for their confidence? Did I model the kind of thinking I want to see?

This seminar is one practice session. There will be many more.</p> <p>Each seminar will be different. Each one will teach you something.
